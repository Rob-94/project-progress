     <center><h1>An amazing diversity of  habitats</h1></center>
     <center><p>Brown bears can be found in many habitats, from the fringes of deserts to high 
         mountain forests and ice fields. In Europe, the brown bear is mostly found in mountain 
         woodlands, in Siberia it occurs primarily in forests while in North America they prefer 
         tundra, alpine meadows and coastlines. The species' main requirements are areas with dense
          cover in which they can shelter by day.<p></center>
