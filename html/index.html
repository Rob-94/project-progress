	    <h1>An amazing diversity of  habitats</h1>
	    <p><em>Brown bears can be found in many habitats, from the fringes of deserts to high 
            mountain forests and ice fields. In Europe, the brown bear is mostly found in mountain 
            woodlands, in Siberia it occurs primarily in forests while in North America they prefer 
            tundra, alpine meadows and coastlines. The species' main requirements are areas with dense
            cover in which they can shelter by day.</em><p>
